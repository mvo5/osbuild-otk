This directory contains reference images generated by the `images`
library [0] so that we can compare test that otk based images are
identical to images produced by the previous `images` implementation.

Generate new ones with:
```
./gen-image-def <images-git-checkout> <distro_name> <distro_ver> <arch> <type> <empty|full>
```
and put them into git. e.g.
```
$ ./gen-image-def ~/devel/osbuild/images centos 9 x86_64 qcow2 empty
$ git add centos/9/x86_64/qcow2/empty/centos_9-x86_64-qcow2-empty.yaml
```
(ideally we would generate them on the fly).


When doing customizations, pass "full" as the last parameter.
